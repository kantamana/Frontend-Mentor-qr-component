## My process

- I collaborated closely with ChatGPT throughout this challenge, which helped me validate decisions and stay on track. Experience from university coursework in computer science gave me a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and GitHub. I also honed my CSS skills through platforms like CSS Battle and CSS Selector, which strengthened my intuition for layout and styling.


### Built with

- Simply HTML5 and CSS, no frameworks
- FlexBox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me get familiar with the conventions that make a project feel complete, such as deploying with GitHub Pages and including a clear README.

### Continued development

In the future I aspire to keep my deliverables tidy and organized, not cutting corners but keeping it proffesional.
